<h1>What Jack did on Wednesday?</h1>
<p>On Wednesday Jack started the day out with a nice jump on my face to wake me up. He then took his daily 9:00am nap. He awoke at about 11:00am to fight his brother Miku in a battle to the death for the last piece of cat food. He lost. But I then refilled his cat bowl anyway. After that, Jack layed back down and took his daily hibernation till midnight. He then awoke again to run around every square inch of the house and wake everyone up like someone had given him too much catnip. The end. </p>

<h3>Jack shall fight Miku, our reigning champ, once again!</h3>
<p>Miku may win again but we shall still show our love and support that one day Jack may bask in his glory of Miku's defeat.</p>
