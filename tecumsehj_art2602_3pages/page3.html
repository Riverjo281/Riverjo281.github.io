<h1>What Jordan did on Wednesday?</h1>
<p>Hello. Yes, I am Jordan. I am the cat mother of Jack and Miku. On Wednesday I heard a marching band go through my room; no wait, that was Miku throwing a tantrum because we were not up by 4:00am like he was. I was used as a trampoline; no wait, that was Jack running from his brother. I endured many food wars and exercise battles but by the end of the night my cat children allowed me some sleep; no wait, they decided to run for hours and keep everyone up.</p>

<p>My cats have big personalities but I love them no matter how many times I am used as a trampoline.Thank you for reading! The end.</p>
