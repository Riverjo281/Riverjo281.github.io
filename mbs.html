        <p>This project is a three part collage called a triptych. Each collage has its own
            theme of mind, body, and spirit. We are using photoshop to culminate photos of
            unique symbolism to showcase who we are through these collages. These
            collages are self-portraits of our intellect, our physical being, and our emotions and
            motivations.</p>
        
           <p> This project was very time consuming and photoshop was very difficult for me to use and
            understand. I am not a computer person and I usually do my art on paper so this project was
            extra difficult for me. But although I had many challenges in the beginning of this project. The
            process of making these collages really helped me understand the different tools that are out
            there to help me and introduced a whole new medium that was available. For my first collage,
            Mind, I had difficulty choosing a first layer that I wanted as my background. I felt that this image
            would be the standing stone for the rest of my images and wanted to make it something that
            could relate with the rest of my images. By the time I got to my last collage, Spirit, I found that
            there is symbolism to positioning every image. Although this project was hard, I enjoyed creating
            things in a new medium and am happy to say that I will continue to work on my skills and
            techniques to make even more projects.</p>
